# python-email-bots

## Purpose
    This repository demonstrates email automation with Python. Email automation can be utilized for mass distribution of information over specified time intervals. In this example, our script logs in to the email provider and sends a transaction growth report to employees on a monthly basis. The report is attached to the email as a PDF. Since the report is a recurring item received by multiple employees, our script automates the monthly distribution of the PDF.
